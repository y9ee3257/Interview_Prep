Did like that the nonfunctional requirements did take into consideration of the other requirements. Decent technical detail and consideration throughout. It was good to add pictures but it was simply defined as an attribute to a table, but Iâ€™m guessing you meant to store and retrieve the pictures differently. Location aspect was also a little unclear but you were able to clarify all the questions I had. Consistent communication throughout.
