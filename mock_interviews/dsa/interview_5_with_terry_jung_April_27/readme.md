## Questions Asked

1. You're given an array of integers and a target Return the min sum of the lengths of two non-overlapping subarrays
   such that the sum of the elements in each subarray equals target Return -1 if not possible Example: Input:
   arr = [3,2,2,4,3], target = 3 Output: 2

Problem Text
You're given an array of integers and a target Return the min sum of the lengths of two non-overlapping subarrays such that the sum of the elements in each subarray equals target Return -1 if not possible
Difficulty
Medium
Understanding
3 — The candidate understood the problem, perhaps with a smidge of effort and/or limited assistance.
Working Solution Proposed
3 — The candidate arrived at a working solution that sufficiently addressed problem requirements for a real-world interview.
Optimized Solution Proposed
3 — The solution was solidly interview-appropriate. It was both sufficiently performant and algorithmically/logically optimized.
Implementation
3 — The solution was implemented in code to a degree acceptable for a real-world interview.
Was a second problem attempted?
No
Verbal Explanation
3 — The candidate sufficiently explained their thinking around each solution.
Hints Needed
3 — Hints were given, but well within the range of acceptable both in number and significance. A real-world interviewer would still see the solution as an achievement of the candidate.
Hints Utilized
3 — The candidate listened to and responded sufficiently well to most hints.
Amount & Severity of Bugs
3 — A small number of bugs were detected and none were substantial enough to raise a red flag. Well done.
Debugging
3 — The candidate was able to identify and fix a sufficient amount of little bugs (and all important bugs) on their own with an acceptable (and limited) amount of assistance from the interviewer.
Time & Space Complexity
3 — The candidate appears to sufficiently understand and communicate time and space complexity.
Code Readability
3 — The code was sufficiently readable.
Language Comfort
3 — The candidate seemed sufficiently comfortable with their programming language. Any quirks noticed are within the realm of acceptable. They are fluent enough to use this language in a real interview.
Communication
3 — Communication was strong. There may or may not have been a few minor quirks. Overall, it was sufficiently clear to pass a real-world interview.
Humility
3 — The candidate demonstrated sufficient humility to command faith in their ability to work well with others.
Energy
3 — The candidate's energy was sufficient to high in one or more areas. Enthusiasm was expressed on a handful of topics and they give enough of an impression of embracing forward momentum.
Interview Anxiety
3 — The candidate was not especially nervous, and any nervousness noticed probably had limited impact on performance, if any.
Technical Score
3 — The candidate demonstrated strength across most technical criteria with trivial hiccups or need for hints. Problem was completely solved and tested, with a sufficient understanding of time/space complexity and appropriate data structures. Will hire.
Behavioral Score
3 — The candidate demonstrates strength across most behavioral criteria. Communication is strong, and they know how to listen and take hints. They ask good questions, may occasionally show enthusiasm, and generally has an overall good demeanor.
Hire Decision
Yes
Candidate Strengths
Went over edge cases and talked over algorithm. Good use of comments in the code. Detailed dry run of the code. Was able to finish implementation before time, correct time and space complexity.
Additional Feedback
Would be good to do more communication while coding. There were some bugs in the code but we didn’t catch it all during the walkthrough, but eventually was able to locate and fix them all. Would get into habit to fully dry run the code.
