1. Google
   1. Solve the problem (even it's bruteforce)
   2. Optimize the problem (once implemented, optimize it)
   3. keep time for followups (interviewers will want time for followup questions on the same problem, always keep additional time)
2. Interview Tips from Sanjeev Qazi
   1. Don't jump into writing code, discuss the approach and time/space complexity before writing code.
   2. Checklist
      1. algorithms
      2. trade-offs
      3. mention the brute force solution as well.
      4. edge cases
      5. test cases
