## Introduction to Serialize and Deserialize Tree Pattern

The Serialize and Deserialize Tree Pattern is commonly used to transform a binary tree into a different format, such as a string or an array, for storage or transmission. Once serialized, the tree can be deserialized to recover its original structure. This pattern is widely applied in systems that require saving or sending binary trees across different platforms or networks. Proper serialization and deserialization ensure that the structure and values of the tree are preserved correctly.

Serialization: In this step, the binary tree is converted into a linear format using methods like pre-order, in-order, or level-order traversal. The serialized data includes both the node values and information about empty nodes (nulls) to maintain the correct structure during deserialization.

Deserialization: This process reads the serialized data and reconstructs the binary tree. It follows the structure provided during serialization and places nodes in the right positions, handling null values to ensure the tree is built exactly as it was before serialization.

Mastering this pattern is essential for solving problems where binary trees need to be stored or shared. Handling both null nodes and maintaining the correct traversal order during serialization and deserialization is the key to preserving the tree's structure.


### Problem Statement
Given a binary tree, your task is to create two functions.

One for serializing the tree into a string format and another for deserializing the string back into the tree.

The serialized string should retain all the tree nodes and their connections, allowing for reconstruction without any loss of data.


```python
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

class Solution:
    def serialize(self, root: TreeNode) -> str:
        # Helper function to recursively serialize tree nodes.
        def helper(node):
            if not node:
                return "X,"
            left_serialized = helper(node.left)
            right_serialized = helper(node.right)
            return str(node.val) + "," + left_serialized + right_serialized
        return helper(root)
    
    def deserialize(self, data: str) -> TreeNode:
        # Convert string to a list for easy access and management.
        nodes = iter(data.split(","))
        
        # Helper function to recursively deserialize tree nodes.
        def helper():
            val = next(nodes)
            if val == "X":
                return None
            node = TreeNode(int(val))
            node.left = helper()
            node.right = helper()
            return node
        return helper()
```
