# Arrays:
# Sort the below list of tuples using the element on their 2nd index in both ascending and descending order
arr = [("def", 6, "abc"), ("xyz", 2, "xyz"), ("abc", 3, "def"), ("uvw", 10, "uvw")]

# convert list to string

# join the below 2 arrays
arr1 = [4, 3, 5, 2, 6]
arr2 = [3, 7, 11, 12, 16]


# Heaps
# sort the elements in the below array using heap. Sort both ascending and descending
arr = [4, 3, 5, 2, 6]

# given a list of tasks with priority, add the elements to a priority queue,
# where you should be able to pop the highest priority element always.
tasks = [(6, "abc"), (2, "xyz"), (3, "def"), (10, "uvw")]

# get n largest and n smallest elements from the below array using heap
arr = [10, 3, 5, 4, 6, 2, 11, 20, 14, 15]
