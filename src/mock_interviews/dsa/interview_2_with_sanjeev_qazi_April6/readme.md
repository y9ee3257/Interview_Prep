## Feedback from Interviewer

Topics Covered
Trees
Problem Text
Convert binary tree to circular doubly linked list
Difficulty
Medium
Understanding
2 — The candidate struggled to understand the problem, but eventually got there with significant effort and/or assistance.
Working Solution Proposed
2 — The candidate arrived at a working solution, but perhaps did not address all problem requirements sufficiently enough for a real-world interview.
Optimized Solution Proposed
2 — The solution was tenable but suboptimal. Perhaps it was brute-force or a bit better than brute-force.
Implementation
1 — Little to no working code was written before we ran out of time.
Was a second problem attempted?
No
Brush-Up on Specific Topics
practice more tree problems. Trees and graphs are common problems in a lot of interviews.
Verbal Explanation
3 — The candidate sufficiently explained their thinking around each solution.
Hints Needed
2 — The candidate relied on a fair amount of hinting, but also made not-insignificant progress on their own.
Hints Utilized
3 — The candidate listened to and responded sufficiently well to most hints.
Amount & Severity of Bugs
Skip — Question is not applicable to this mock OR too hard to say OR no time to discern.
Debugging
Skip — Question is not applicable to this mock OR too hard to say OR no time to discern.
Time & Space Complexity
3 — The candidate appears to sufficiently understand and communicate time and space complexity.
Code Readability
Skip — Question is not applicable to this mock OR too hard to say OR no time to discern.
Language Comfort
3 — The candidate seemed sufficiently comfortable with their programming language. Any quirks noticed are within the realm of acceptable. They are fluent enough to use this language in a real interview.
Communication
3 — Communication was strong. There may or may not have been a few minor quirks. Overall, it was sufficiently clear to pass a real-world interview.
Humility
4 — The candidate demonstrated exceptional humility. At no point could it even be possible to mistake this person as arrogant. It was a pleasure to engage with them.
Energy
3 — The candidate's energy was sufficient to high in one or more areas. Enthusiasm was expressed on a handful of topics and they give enough of an impression of embracing forward momentum.
Interview Anxiety
3 — The candidate was not especially nervous, and any nervousness noticed probably had limited impact on performance, if any.
Technical Score
2 — The candidate needs significant improvement in one or more areas. Perhaps the problem was partially solved or untested. Perhaps understanding of time/space complexity was unclear or suboptimal algorithms were employed.
Behavioral Score
3 — The candidate demonstrates strength across most behavioral criteria. Communication is strong, and they know how to listen and take hints. They ask good questions, may occasionally show enthusiasm, and generally has an overall good demeanor.
Hire Decision
No
Candidate Strengths
Good communication. Good job proactively calling out time and space. Had the right intuition, but conversion to code became the blocking step
Additional Feedback
Please try the Number occurring once problem ( looking for a solution : time log N, space constant ) And let me know if any questions ( my email is in the invite). Maybe I will see u in another mock. Good job proactively talking about time and space. Note that if the tree is completely skewed, space will be linear ( and for a recursive solution, will not scale to a big tree as it will run out of stack space…these are good points to mention). Should read question carefully. Looks like you didn’t look at the examples, this sometimes happens because we are conscious of the short time and in a hurry. We walked thru how we could solve this problem. Convert BT to CDLL: Time: N Space: log N. But this is best case, worst case will be linear O (N) if tree is completey skewed
