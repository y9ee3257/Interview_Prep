## Feedback from conversation
1. Explain different approaches, give trade-offs. This is must if you are applying for a senior software engineer.
2. Always write your own test cases, talk about all possible edge cases. Do not only test with a couple of test cases and call it done.
3. Avoid typos, a lot of typos are found, making it harder to run the code.


### Questions at the end
1. Asked about systems design
   1. Not everyone use all the components in the systems design, just make sure you know how it works and give tradeoffs (important).
   2. Have conversational practice, you can use ChatGPT for this.
   
### Interviewer Feedback
# Topics Covered

## Trees

### Problem Text
Vertical order traversal. Top-down view.

**Difficulty:** Medium

### Understanding
**4** — The candidate quickly and clearly understood the problem, with little to no resistance in processing what was being asked.

### Working Solution Proposed
**4** — The candidate arrived at a working solution that addressed all problem requirements and covered all possible edge cases. Well done.

### Optimized Solution Proposed
**4** — The solution was a beast. Not only was it maximally performant and algorithmically/logically appropriate, but it was elegant on a whole other level.

### Implementation
**4** — The solution was fully implemented in code, with all bases covered meticulously.

## Was a second problem attempted?
**Yes**

# Brush-Up on Specific Topics
**Spectacular!**

## Verbal Explanation
**3** — The candidate sufficiently explained their thinking around each solution.

## Hints Needed
**4** — No hints were needed at all. Stellar and impressive.

## Hints Utilized
**4** — The candidate heard, understood, and made maximal use of all hints given.

## Amount & Severity of Bugs
**4** — No bugs detected. Code was flawless. Extremely well done!

## Debugging
**4** — The candidate was able to both identify and fix all bugs on their own with negligible assistance from the interviewer.

## Time & Space Complexity
**4** — The candidate had a nuanced grasp of time and space complexity and was able to articulate their understanding crisply and quickly.

## Code Readability
**3** — The code was sufficiently readable.

## Language Comfort
**3** — The candidate seemed sufficiently comfortable with their programming language. Any quirks noticed are within the realm of acceptable. They are fluent enough to use this language in a real interview.

## Communication
**3** — Communication was strong. There may or may not have been a few minor quirks. Overall, it was sufficiently clear to pass a real-world interview.

## Humility
**3** — The candidate demonstrated sufficient humility to command faith in their ability to work well with others.

## Energy
**3** — The candidate's energy was sufficient to high in one or more areas. Enthusiasm was expressed on a handful of topics and they gave enough of an impression of embracing forward momentum.

## Interview Anxiety
**3** — The candidate was not especially nervous, and any nervousness noticed probably had limited impact on performance, if any.

# Scores

## Technical Score
**4** — The candidate's technical performance was stellar. They made smooth progress through the problem, code was fluent, and testing was second nature. The interviewer may even have learned something from their solution. Strong hire.

## Behavioral Score
**3** — The candidate demonstrates strength across most behavioral criteria. Communication is strong, and they know how to listen and take hints. They ask good questions, may occasionally show enthusiasm, and generally have an overall good demeanor.

# Hire Decision
**Yes**

# Candidate Strengths
Solved 3 questions is amazing. Technically strong.

# Additional Feedback
Work on communications that involve addressing trade-offs and multiple options to solve questions instead of just one best optimal approach.
