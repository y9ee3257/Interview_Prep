1. what is a vertex
2. what is an edge

Edges representation
1. Edge List
2. Adjacency List
3. Adjacency Map
4. Adjacency Matrix


1. what are connected components
   1. vertices that have a relationship at some level is called a connected component in a graph. 
2. directed vs undirected dsa.by_topic.graphs
3. Adj list for directed vs un-directed graph?
   1. adj list will have twice the number of edges for undirected graph
   2. adj list will be the same number of edges for directed graph

Types of Edges
1. Tree Edge
2. Cross Edge
3. Back Edge
4. Forward Edge

Types of edges is an undirected graph:
DFS  
Tree Edge, Back Edge  
BFS  
Tree Edge, Cross Edge  

Types of edges in a directed graph:  
DFS  
Tree Edge, Back Edge, Cross Edge, Forward Edge   
BFS   
Tree Edge, Back Edge, Cross Edge
