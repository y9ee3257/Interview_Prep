Pattern Questions:   
By learning the below pattern questions, you will be able to solve around 80 DP questions.

1. 0-1 knapsack (6 variations)
   1. Subset sum
   2. Equal sum partition
   3. count of subset sum
   4. minimum subset sum diff
   5. target sum
   6. count of subset sum with given difference 
2. unbounded knapsack (5 variations)
   1. unbounded knapsack
   2. rod cutting
   3. coin change
   4. min coin change
   5. max ribbon cut
3. Fibonacci sequence (7 variations)
4. Longest Common Subsequence (15 variations)
5. Longest Increasing Subsequence (10 variations)
6. Kandane's Algorithm (6 variations)
7. Matrix Chain Multiplication (7 variations)
8. DP on trees (4 variations)
9. DP on Grid (14 variations)
10. Others (5 variations)

Identifying DP problem:   
1. Question asks for optimal (max, min, count ...)
2. you will have choice at every step (include, exclude)

Do not go for tabulation as your initial approach. 
You first need to write the recursive solution only then you will be able to come up with tabulation method.
Try to use memoization and if time permits solve using tabulation.
